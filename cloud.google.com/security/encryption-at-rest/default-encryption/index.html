<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>For many individuals and companies, security is a deciding factor in choosing a
public cloud vendor. At Google, security is of the utmost importance. We take
security and privacy seriously, and we work tirelessly to protect your
data — whether it is traveling over the Internet, moving between our data
centers, or stored on our servers.</p>
<p>Central to our comprehensive security strategy is encryption in transit and at
rest, which ensures the data can be accessed only by the authorized roles and
services with audited access to the encryption keys. This paper describes
Google’s approach to encryption at rest for the Google Cloud Platform, and how
Google uses it to keep your information more secure.</p>
<p>This document is targeted at CISOs and security operations teams currently
using or considering using Google Cloud Platform. With the exception of the
introduction, this document assumes a basic understanding of encryption and
cryptographic primitives.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_encryption">What is encryption</h3>
<p>Encryption is a process that takes legible data as input (often called
plaintext), and transforms it into an output (often called ciphertext) that
reveals little or no information about the plaintext. The encryption algorithm
used is public, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), but execution
depends on a key, which is kept secret. To decrypt the ciphertext back to its
original form, you need to employ the key. At Google, the use of encryption to
keep data confidential is usually combined with integrity protection; someone
with access to the ciphertext can neither understand it nor make a modification
without knowledge of the key. For more information on cryptography, a good
resource is an
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html">Introduction to Modern Cryptography</a>.</p>
<p>In this whitepaper, we focus on encryption at rest. By <em>encryption at rest</em>, we
mean encryption used to protect data that is stored on a disk
(including solid-state drives) or backup media.</p>
<h3 id="why_encryption_helps_secure_customer_data">Why encryption helps secure customer data</h3>
<p>Encryption is one piece of a broader security strategy. Encryption adds a layer
of defense in depth for protecting data — encryption ensures that if the data
accidentally falls into an attacker’s hands, they cannot access the data without
also having access to the encryption keys. Even if an attacker obtains the
storage devices containing your data, they won’t be able to understand or
decrypt it.</p>
<p>Encryption at rest reduces the surface of attack by effectively "cutting out"
the lower layers of the hardware and software stack. Even if these lower layers
are compromised (for example, through physical access to devices), the data on
those devices is not compromised if adequate encryption is deployed. Encryption
also acts as a "chokepoint" — centrally managed encryption keys create a single
place where access to data is enforced and can be audited.</p>
<p>Encryption provides an important mechanism in how Google ensures the privacy of
customer data — it allows systems to manipulate data, e.g., for backup, and
engineers to support our infrastructure, without providing access to content.</p>
<h3 id="what_we_consider_customer_data">What we consider customer data</h3>
<p>As defined in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/">Google Cloud Platform terms of service</a>, <em>customer
data</em> refers to content provided to Google by a Google Cloud Platform customer
(or at their direction), directly or indirectly, via Google Cloud Platform
services used by that customer’s account. Customer data includes customer
content and customer metadata.</p>
<p><em>Customer content</em> is data that Google Cloud Platform customers generate
themselves or provide to Google, like data stored in Google Cloud Storage,
disk snapshots used by Google Compute Engine, and Cloud IAM policies. The
encryption at rest of customer content is the focus of this whitepaper.</p>
<p><em>Customer metadata</em> makes up the rest of customer data, and refers to all data
that cannot be classified as customer content. This could include auto-generated
project numbers, timestamps, and IP addresses, as well as the byte size of an
object in Google Cloud Storage, or the machine type in Google Compute Engine.
Metadata is protected to a degree that is reasonable for ongoing performance
and operations.</p>
<h2 id="googles_default_encryption">Google’s default encryption</h2>
<h3 id="encryption_of_data_at_rest">Encryption of data at rest</h3>
<h4 id="layers_of_encryption">Layers of encryption</h4>
<p>Google uses several layers of encryption to protect data. Using multiple layers
of encryption adds redundant data protection and allows us to select the optimal
approach based on application requirements.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.google.com/images/security/whitepaper-chart-01.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Several layers of encryption are used to protect data stored in
Google Cloud Platform. Either distributed file system encryption or database
and file storage encryption is in place for almost all files; and storage device
encryption is in place for almost all files.</em></p>
<h4 id="encryption_at_the_storage_system_layer">Encryption at the storage system layer</h4>
<p>To understand how specifically Google Cloud Storage encryption works, it’s
important to understand how Google stores customer data. Data is broken into
subfile chunks for storage; each chunk can be up to several GB in size. Each
chunk is encrypted at the storage level with an individual encryption key: two
chunks will not have the same encryption key, even if they are part of the same
Google Cloud Storage object, owned by the same customer, or stored on the same
machine<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>. If a chunk of data is updated, it is
encrypted with a new key, rather than by reusing the existing key. This
partition of data, each using a different key, means the "blast radius" of a
potential data encryption key compromise is limited to only that data chunk.</p>
<p>Google encrypts data prior to it being written to disk. Encryption is inherent
in all of Google’s storage systems — rather than added on afterward.</p>
<p>Each data chunk has a unique identifier. Access control lists (ACLs) ensure that
each chunk can be decrypted only by Google services operating under authorized
roles, which are granted access at that point in time. This prevents access to
the data without authorization, bolstering both data security and privacy.</p>
<p>Each chunk is distributed across Google’s storage systems, and is replicated in
encrypted form for backup and disaster recovery. A malicious individual who
wanted to access customer data would need to know and be able to access
(1) all storage chunks corresponding to the data they want, and (2) the
encryption keys corresponding to the chunks.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.google.com/images/security/whitepaper-chart-02.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Data at Google is broken up into encrypted chunks for storage.</em></p>
<p>Google uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt data at
rest. AES is widely used because (1) <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar1.pdf">both AES256 and AES128 are recommended by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for long-term storage
use</a>
(as of November 2015), and (2) AES is often included as part of customer
compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Data stored across Google Cloud Storage is encrypted at the storage level using
AES, in <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/gcm/gcm-spec.pdf">Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)</a>
in almost all cases. This is implemented in the
<a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL library</a> that Google
maintains. This library was forked from OpenSSL for internal use, after
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html">many flaws were exposed in OpenSSL</a>.
In select cases, AES is used in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with a hashed
message authentication code (HMAC) for authentication; and for some replicated
files, AES is used in Counter (CTR) mode with HMAC. (Further details on
algorithms are provided
<a href="#googles_common_cryptographic_library">later in this document</a>.) In other
Google Cloud Platform products, AES is used in a variety of modes.</p>
<h4 id="encryption_at_the_storage_device_layer">Encryption at the storage device layer</h4>
<p>In addition to the storage system level encryption described above, in most
cases data is also encrypted at the storage device level, with at least AES128
for hard disks (HDD) and AES256 for new solid state drives (SSD), using a
separate device-level key (which is different than the key used to encrypt the
data at the storage level). As older devices are replaced, solely AES256 will
be used for device-level encryption.</p>
<h4 id="encryption_of_backups">Encryption of backups</h4>
<p>Google’s backup system ensures that data remains encrypted throughout the backup
process. This approach avoids unnecessarily exposing plaintext data.</p>
<p>In addition, the backup system further encrypts each backup file independently
with its own data encryption key (DEK), derived from a key stored in Google’s
Key Management Service (KMS) plus a randomly generated per-file seed at backup
time. Another DEK is used for all metadata in backups, which is also stored in
Google’s KMS. (Further information on key management is in
<a href="#key_management">a later section</a>.)</p>
<h4 id="cases-data-encrypt">Are there cases where data is not encrypted at rest?</h4>
<p><strong>Google Cloud Platform encrypts customer content stored at rest, without any
action from the customer, using one or more encryption mechanisms, with the
following exceptions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Serial console logs from virtual machines in Google Compute Engine; this is
   currently being remediated</li>
<li>Core dumps written to local drives, when a process fails unexpectedly; this
   is currently being remediated</li>
<li>Debugging logs written to local disk; this is currently being remediated</li>
<li>Temporary files used by storage systems; this is currently being remediated</li>
<li>Some logs that may include customer content as well as customer metadata;
   this is planned for remediation</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is still protected extensively by the rest of Google’s security
infrastructure, and in almost all cases still protected by storage-level
encryption.</p>
<h3 id="key_management">Key management</h3>
<h4 id="data_encryption_keys_key_encryption_keys_and_googles_key_management_service">Data encryption keys, key encryption keys, and Google’s Key Management Service</h4>
<p>The key used to encrypt the data in a chunk is called a <em>data encryption key
(DEK)</em>. Because of the high volume of keys at Google, and the need for low
latency and high availability, these keys are stored near the data that they
encrypt. The DEKs are encrypted with (or “wrapped” by) a <em>key encryption key
(KEK)</em>. One or more KEKs exist for each Google Cloud Platform service. These
KEKs are stored centrally in Google’s <em>Key Management Service (KMS)</em>, a
repository built specifically for storing keys. Having a smaller number of
KEKs than DEKs and using a central key management service makes storing and
encrypting data at Google scale manageable, and allows us to track and control
data access from a central point.</p>
<p>For each Google Cloud Platform customer, any non-shared
resources<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> are split into data chunks and encrypted
with keys separate from keys used for other customers<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>.
These DEKs are even separate from those that protect other pieces of the same
data owned by that same customer.</p>
<p>DEKs are generated by the storage system using Google’s common cryptographic
library. They are then sent to KMS to wrap with that storage system’s KEK, and
the wrapped DEKs are passed back to the storage system to be kept with the data
chunks. When a storage system needs to retrieve encrypted data, it retrieves
the wrapped DEK and passes it to KMS. KMS then verifies that this service is
authorized to use the KEK, and if so, unwraps and returns the plaintext DEK to
the service. The service then uses the DEK to decrypt the data chunk into
plaintext and verify its integrity.</p>
<p>Most KEKs for encrypting data chunks are generated within KMS, and the rest are
generated inside the storage services. For consistency, all KEKs are generated
using Google’s common cryptographic library, using a random number generator
(RNG) built by Google. This RNG is based on NIST 800-90Ar1 CTR-DRBG and
generates an
AES256 KEK<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>. This RNG is seeded from the Linux
kernel’s RNG, which in turn is seeded from multiple independent entropy sources.
This includes entropic events from the data center environment, such as
fine-grained measurements of disk seeks and inter-packet arrival times, and
<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-digital-random-number-generator-drng-software-implementation-guide">Intel’s RDRAND instruction</a>
where it is available (on Ivy Bridge and newer CPUs).</p>
<p>Data stored in Google Cloud Platform is encrypted with DEKs using AES256 or
AES128, as described above; and any new data encrypted in persistent disks in
Google Compute Engine is encrypted using AES256. DEKs are wrapped with KEKs
using AES256 or AES128, depending on the Google Cloud Platform service. We are
currently working on upgrading all KEKs for Cloud services to AES256.</p>
<p>Google’s KMS manages KEKs, and was built solely for this purpose. It was
designed with security in mind. KEKs are not exportable from Google’s KMS by
design; all encryption and decryption with these keys must be done within KMS.
This helps prevent leaks and misuse, and enables KMS to emit an audit trail
when keys are used.</p>
<p>KMS can automatically rotate KEKs at regular time intervals, using Google’s
common cryptographic library to generate new keys. Though we often refer to
just a single key, we really mean that data is protected using a key set: one
key active for encryption and a set of historical keys for decryption, the
number of which is determined by the <em>key rotation schedule</em>. The actual
rotation schedule for a KEK varies by service, but the standard rotation period
is 90 days. Google Cloud Storage specifically rotates its KEKs every 90 days,
and can store up to 20 versions, requiring re-encryption of data at least once
every 5 years (though in practice, data re-encryption is much more frequent).
KMS-held keys are backed up for disaster recovery purposes, and they are
indefinitely recoverable.</p>
<p>The use of KEKs is managed by access control lists (ACLs) in KMS for each key,
with a per-key policy. Only authorized Google services and users are allowed
access to a key. The use of each key is tracked at the level of the individual
operation that requires that key — so every time an individual uses a key,
it is authenticated and logged. All human data accesses are auditable as part
of Google’s overall security and privacy policies.</p>
<p>When a Google Cloud Platform service accesses an encrypted chunk of data,
here’s what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>The service makes a call to the storage system for the data it needs.</li>
<li>The storage system identifies the chunks in which that data is stored
   (the chunk IDs) and where they are stored.</li>
<li>For each chunk, the storage system pulls the wrapped DEK stored with that
   chunk (in some cases, this is done by the service), and sends it to KMS for
   unwrapping.</li>
<li>The storage system verifies that the identified job is allowed to access
   that data chunk based on a job identifier, and using the chunk ID; and KMS
   verifies that the storage system is authorized both to use the KEK associated
   with the service, and to unwrap that specific DEK.</li>
<li>KMS does one of the following:<ul>
<li>Passes the unwrapped DEK back to the storage system, which decrypts the
    data chunk and passes it to the service. Or, in some rare cases,</li>
<li>Passes the unwrapped DEK to the service; the storage system passes the
    encrypted data chunk to the service, which decrypts the data chunk and
    uses it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is different in dedicated storage devices, such as local SSDs,
where the device manages and protects the device-level DEK.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.google.com/images/security/whitepaper-chart-03.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3: To decrypt a data chunk, the storage service calls Google’s Key
Management Service (KMS) to retrieve the unwrapped data encryption key (DEK)
for that data chunk.</em></p>
<h4 id="encryption_key_hierarchy_and_root_of_trust">Encryption key hierarchy and root of trust</h4>
<p>Google’s KMS is protected by a root key called the <em>KMS master key</em>, which wraps
all the KEKs in KMS. This KMS master key is AES256<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>,
and is itself stored in another key management service, called the <em>Root KMS</em>.
Root KMS stores a much smaller number of keys — approximately a dozen. For
additional security, Root KMS is not run on general production machines, but
instead is run only on dedicated machines in each Google data center.</p>
<p>Root KMS in turn has its own root key, called the <em>root KMS master key</em>, which
is also AES256<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> and is stored in a peer-to-peer
infrastructure, <em>the root KMS master key distributor</em>, which replicates these
keys globally. The root KMS master key distributor only holds the keys in RAM
on the same dedicated machines as Root KMS, and uses logging to verify proper
use. One instance of the root KMS master key distributor runs for every
instance of Root KMS. (The root KMS master key distributor is still being
phased in, to replace a system that operated in a similar manner but was not
peer to peer.)</p>
<p>When a new instance of the root KMS master key distributor is started, it is
configured with a list of host names already running distributor instances.
Distributor instances can then obtain the root KMS master key from other
running instances. Other than the disaster-recovery mechanisms described below,
the root KMS master key exists only in RAM on a limited number of specially
secured machines.</p>
<p>To address the scenario where all instances of the root KMS master key
distributor restart simultaneously, the root KMS master key is also backed up
on secure hardware devices stored in physical safes in highly secured areas in
two physically separated, global Google locations. This backup would be needed
only if all distributor instances were to go down at once; for example, in a
global restart. Fewer than 20 Google employees are able to access these safes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.google.com/images/security/whitepaper-chart-04.png" style="max-width:540px;"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4: The encryption key hierarchy protects a chunk of data with a DEK,

<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is chunked and encrypted with DEKs</li>
<li>DEKs are encrypted with KEKs</li>
<li>KEKs are stored in KMS</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>The root KMS master key distributor is a peer-to-peer infrastructure running
  concurrently in RAM globally on dedicated machines; each gets its key material

  limited Google locations</li>

  replace a system that operated in a similar manner but was not peer to
  peer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="global_availability_and_replication">Global availability and replication</h4>
<p>High availability and low latency, global access to keys, are critical at every
level; these characteristics are needed for key management services to be used
across Google.</p>
<p>For this reason, KMS is highly scalable, and it is replicated thousands of times
in Google’s data centers globally. It is run on regular machines in Google’s
production fleet, and instances of KMS run globally to support Google Cloud
Platform operations. As a result, the latency of any single key operation is
very low.</p>
<p>Root KMS is run on several machines dedicated to security operations, in each
data center. The root KMS master key distributor is run on these same machines,
one-to-one with Root KMS. The root KMS master key distributor provides a
distribution mechanism via a <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=41840.41841">gossiping protocol</a>
— at a fixed time interval, each instance of the distributor picks a random other
instance to compare its keys with, and reconciles any differences in key versions.
With this model, there is no central node that all of Google’s infrastructure depends
on; this allows Google to maintain and protect key material with high availability.</p>
<h3 id="googles_common_cryptographic_library">Google’s common cryptographic library</h3>
<p>Google’s common cryptographic library is
<a href="https://github.com/google/crunchy">CrunchyCrypt</a><sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>,
which implements cryptographic algorithms using
<a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL</a><sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>.
CrunchyCrypt is available to all Google developers. Because this common library
is widely accessible, only a small team of cryptographers needs to properly
implement this tightly controlled and reviewed code — it's not necessary for
every team at Google to "roll their own" cryptography. A special Google security
team is responsible for maintaining this common cryptographic library for all
products.</p>
<p>The CrunchyCrypt encryption library supports a wide variety of encryption key
types and modes, and these are reviewed regularly to ensure they are current
with the latest attacks.</p>
<p>At the time of this document’s publication, Google uses the following encryption
algorithms for encryption at rest for DEKs and KEKs. These are subject to
change as we continue to improve our capabilities and security.</p>

<h2 id="additional_encryption_options_for_cloud_customers">Additional encryption options for Cloud customers</h2>
<p>In addition to providing encryption by default in Google Cloud Platform, we are
working to offer customers additional encryption and key management options for
greater control.</p>
<p>We want to enable Google Cloud Platform customers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain the ultimate custodian of their data, and be able to control access to
  and use of that data at the finest level of granularity, to ensure both data
  security and privacy</li>
<li>Manage encryption for their cloud-hosted data in the same way they currently
  do on-premises — or, ideally, better</li>
<li>Have a provable and auditable root of trust over their resources</li>
<li>Be able to further separate and segregate their data, beyond the use of ACLs</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers can use existing encryption keys that they manage with the Google
Cloud Platform, using the Customer supplied encryption keys feature. This
feature is available for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-supplied-keys">Google Cloud Storage</a>
and for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption">Google Compute Engine</a>
for storage layer encryption.</p>
<p>Customers can also manage their own encryption keys on Google Cloud Platform
using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms">Google Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS)</a>. This product
allows for application-layer encryption managed by the customer.</p>
<h2 id="research_and_innovation_in_cryptography">Research and innovation in cryptography</h2>
<p>To keep pace with the evolution of encryption, Google has a team of world-class
security engineers tasked with following, developing, and improving encryption
technology. Our engineers take part in standardization processes and in
maintaining widely used encryption software.
<a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/research/">We regularly publish our research</a>
in the field of encryption so that everyone in the industry — including the
general public — can benefit from our knowledge. For example, in 2014 we
revealed a significant vulnerability in SSL 3.0 encryption
(known as <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html">POODLE</a>),
and in 2015 we identified a high-risk vulnerability in
<a href="https://openssl.org/news/secadv/20150709.txt">OpenSSL</a>.</p>
<p>Google plans to remain the industry leader in encryption for cloud services.
In terms of developing, implementing, and researching newer cryptographic
techniques, we have teams working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Partially homomorphic cryptography</em>, which allows some operations to be
  performed on data while it is encrypted, so the cloud never sees the data in
  plaintext, even in memory. One place this technology is being used is as part
  of our experimental
  <a href="https://github.com/google/encrypted-bigquery-client">encrypted BigQuery client</a>,
  which is openly available.</li>
<li><em>Format- and order- preserving cryptography</em>, which allows some comparison and
  ranking operations to be performed on data while it is encrypted.</li>
<li><em>Post-quantum cryptography</em>, which allows us to replace existing crypto
  primitives that are vulnerable to efficient quantum attacks with post-quantum
  candidates that are believed to be more robust against such attacks. The
  primary focus here is in researching and prototyping lattice-based public-key
  cryptography, including NIST recommendations on post-quantum algorithms.
  Lattice-based crypto is currently thought to be <a href="https://pqcrypto.org/www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783540887010-c1.pdf">one of the most likely
  encryption techniques to be used in a
  post-quantum world</a>,
  although we are still in early days in terms of best algorithms, concrete
  parameters, and cryptanalysis for applying lattice-based crypto. Although
  symmetric key encryption and MACs are weakened by known quantum algorithms,
  they can still be upgraded to similar bits of security in a post-quantum
  world by doubling key sizes.</li>
