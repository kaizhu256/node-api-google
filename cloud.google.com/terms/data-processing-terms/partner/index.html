Member State.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Processing of Partner Personal Data</strong>.</p>

  <p>5.1 <u>Controller and Processor</u>. If the Data Protection Legislation applies to the
processing of Partner Personal Data, then as between the parties, the parties
acknowledge and agree that:</p>

  <p>(a) Google will be a processor of the Partner Personal Data and will, within the scope
of the Agreement, comply with its obligations as a processor under the Agreement; and</p>

  <p>(b) where Partner is a controller with respect to certain Partner Personal Data it will,
within the scope of the Agreement, comply with its obligations as a controller under the
Data Protection Legislation in respect of that Partner Personal Data.</p>

   <p>5.2 <u>Customers</u>. Where Partner is not the controller of certain Partner Personal Data,
Partner represents and warrants to Google that:</p>

  <p>(a) it is authorized to provide the Instructions, and otherwise act on behalf of the
applicable controller, in relation to that Partner Personal Data; and</p>

  <p>(b) Google’s processing of the Partner Personal Data, in accordance with the
Instructions, will not breach the Data Protection Legislation.</p>

  <p>Appendix 1 sets out a description of the categories of data that may fall within Partner
    Personal Data and of the categories of data subjects to which that data may relate.</p>

  <p>5.3 <u>Scope of Processing</u>. Google will only process Partner Personal Data in
accordance with the Instructions, and will not process Partner Personal Data for any
other purpose.</p>

   <p>5.4 <u>Additional Products</u>. Partner acknowledges that if Additional Products are
installed, used or enabled via the Admin Console or otherwise under the Partner’s
Account, then the Services may allow such Additional Products to access Partner Data
as required for the interoperation of those Additional Products with the Services. The
Agreement does not apply to the processing of data transmitted to or from such
Additional Products. Such Additional Products are not required to use the Services.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Data Security; Security Compliance; Audits</strong>.</p>

  <p>6.1 <u>Security Measures</u>. Google will take and implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to protect Partner Data against accidental or unlawful
destruction or accidental loss or alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access, or
other unauthorized processing, as detailed in Appendix 2 (the "Security Measures").
Google may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time provided that
such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security
of the Services. Partner agrees that it is solely responsible for its and its Customers’ use
of the Services, including securing its and their account authentication credentials, and
that Google has no obligation to protect Partner Data that Partner or its Customers elect
to store or transfer outside of Google’s and its Subprocessors’ systems (e.g., offline or
on-premise storage).</p>

     <p>6.2 <u>Security Compliance by Google Staff</u>. Google will take appropriate steps to
ensure compliance with the Security Measures by its employees, contractors and
Subprocessors to the extent applicable to their scope of performance.</p>
     <p>6.3 <u>Data Incidents</u>.  If Google becomes aware of a Data Incident, Google will promptly
notify Partner of the Data Incident, and take reasonable steps to minimize harm and
secure Partner Data. Notification(s) of any Data Incident(s) will be delivered to the email
address provided by Partner in the Agreement (or in the Admin Console) or, at Google’s
discretion, by direct Partner communication (e.g., by phone call or an in-person
meeting). Partner acknowledges that it is solely responsible for ensuring that the
contact information set forth above is current and valid, and for fulfilling any third party
notification obligations. Partner agrees that “Data Incidents” do not include: (i)
unsuccessful access attempts or similar events that do not compromise the security or
privacy of Partner Data, including pings, port scans, denial of service attacks, and other
network attacks on firewalls or networked systems; or (ii) accidental loss or disclosure
of Partner Data caused by Partner’s or its Customers’ use of the Services or Partner’s or
its Customers’ loss of account authentication credentials. Google’s obligation to report
or respond to a Data Incident under this Section will not be construed as an
acknowledgement by Google of any fault or liability with respect to the Data Incident.</p>
     <p>6.4 <u>Compliance with Security and Privacy Standards; SOC 2 and 3 Reports</u>. During
the Term, Google will maintain the following:</p>
     <p>(a) its ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Certification or a comparable certification for the following
Services: Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google
Cloud Datastore, Google BigQuery Service, Google Cloud SQL, and Google Genomics
(“ISO 27001 Certification”);</p>
     <p>(b) its confidential Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 report (or a comparable
report) on Google’s systems examining logical security controls, physical security
controls, and system availability applicable to the following Services: Google App
Engine, Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Datastore, Google
BigQuery Service and Google Cloud SQL (“SOC 2 Report”), as produced by the Third

to the following Services: Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud
Storage, Google Cloud Datastore, Google BigQuery Service and Google Cloud SQL (“SOC
3 Report”), as produced by the Third Party Auditor and updated at least once every
eighteen (18) months.</p>

     <p>6.5 Auditing Security Compliance.</p>
     <p>6.5.1 <u>Reviews of Security Documentation</u>. Google will make the following available for
review by Partner:</p>
     <p>(a) the certificate issued in relation to Google’s ISO 27001 Certification;</p>
     <p>(b) the then-current SOC 3 Report;</p>
     <p>(c) a summary or redacted version of the then-current confidential SOC 2 Report; and</p>
     <p>(d) following a request by Partner in accordance with Section 6.5.4 below, the thencurrent
confidential SOC 2 Report.</p>
     <p>6.5.2 <u>Partner Audits</u>. If Partner has entered into Model Contract Clauses as described
in Section 10.2 of these Terms, Partner may exercise the audit rights granted under
clauses 5(f) and 12(2) of such Model Contract Clauses:</p>
     <p>(a) by instructing Google to execute the audit as described in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.1
       above; and/or</p>
     <p>(b) following a request by Partner in accordance with Section 6.5.4 below, by executing
       an audit as described in such Model Contract Clauses.</p>
     <p>6.5.3 <u>Additional Business Terms for Reviews and Audits</u>. Google and Partner will
discuss and agree in advance on:</p>
     <p>(a) the reasonable date(s) of and security and confidentiality controls applicable to any
Partner review under Section 6.5.1(d); and</p>
<p>(b) the identity of a suitably qualified independent auditor for any audit under Section
6.5.2(b), and the reasonable start date, scope and duration of and security and
confidentiality controls applicable to any such audit.</p>
<p>Google reserves the right to charge a fee (based on Google’s reasonable costs) for any
review under Section 6.5.1(d) and/or audit under Section 6.5.2(b). For clarity, Google is
not responsible for any costs incurred or fees charged by any third party auditor
appointed by Partner in connection with an audit under Section 6.5.2(b). Nothing in this
Section 6.5 varies or modifies any rights or obligations of Partner or Google LLC under
any Model Contract Clauses entered into as described in Section 10.2 (Transfers of
Data Out of the EEA) of these Terms.</p>
     <p>6.5.4 <u>Requests for Reviews and Audits</u>. Any requests under Section 6.5.1 or 6.5.2 must
be sent to the Data Privacy Office as described in Section 9 (Data Privacy Office for
Google Cloud Platform) of these Terms.</p>

     <p><strong>7. Data Correction, Blocking, Exporting, and Deletion</strong>.</p>
     <p>During the Term, Google will provide Partner with the ability to correct, block, export and
delete the Partner Data in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Services and
in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Once Partner deletes Partner Data via
the Services such that the Partner Data cannot be recovered by Partner (the “PartnerDeleted
Data”), Google will delete the Partner-Deleted Data within a maximum period of
180 days, unless applicable legislation or legal process prevents it from doing so. On
the expiry or termination of the Agreement (or, if applicable on expiry of any posttermination
period during which Google may agree to continue providing access to the
Services), after a recovery period of up to 30 days following such expiry or termination,
Google will thereafter delete the Partner-Deleted Data within a maximum period of 180
days, unless applicable legislation or legal process prevents it from doing so.</p>

     <p><strong>8. Access; Export of Data</strong>.</p>
     <p>During the Term, Google will make available to Partner the Partner Data in a manner
consistent with the functionality of the Services and in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement. To the extent Partner, in its use and administration of the Services during
the Term, does not have the ability to amend or delete Partner Data (as required by
applicable law), or migrate Partner Data to another system or service provider, Google
will, at Partner’s reasonable expense, comply with any reasonable requests by Partner
to assist in facilitating such actions to the extent Google is legally permitted to do so
and has reasonable access to the relevant Partner Data.</p>

     <p><strong>9. Data Privacy Office for Google Cloud Platform</strong>.</p>
     <p>Google’s Data Privacy Office for Google Cloud Platform can be contacted by Partner
administrators at: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/dpo (or via such other
means as Google may provide).</p>

     <p><strong>10. Data Transfers</strong>.</p>
     <p>10.1 <u>Data Location and Transfers</u>. Partner may select where certain Partner Data will
be stored (the "Data Location Selection"), and Google will store it there in accordance
with the Service Specific Terms. If a Data Location Selection is not covered by the
Service Specific Terms (or a Data Location Selection is not made by Partner in respect
of any Partner Data), Google may store and process the relevant Partner Data anywhere
       Google or its Subprocessors maintain facilities.</p>
     <p>10.2 <u>Transfers of Data Out of the EEA</u>.</p>
     <p>10.2.1 <u>Partner Obligations</u>. If the storage and/or processing of Partner Data (as set out
in Section 10.1 above) involves transfers of Partner Personal Data out of the EEA, and
Data Protection Legislation applies to the transfers of such data (“Transferred Personal
Data”), Partner acknowledges that Data Protection Legislation will require Partner to
enter into Model Contract Clauses in respect of such transfers, unless Google has
       adopted an Alternative Transfer Solution.</p>
     <p>10.2.2 <u>Google Obligations</u>. In respect of Transferred Personal Data, Google will:</p>
<p>(a) if requested to do so by Partner, ensure that Google LLC as the importer of the
Transferred Personal Data enters into Model Contract Clauses with Partner as the
exporter of such data, and that the transfers are made in accordance with such Model
       Contract Clauses; and/or</p>
<p>(b) adopt an Alternative Transfer Solution and ensure that the transfers are made in
       accordance with such solution.</p>
<p>10.3 Data Center Information. Google will make available to Partner information about
the countries in which data centers used to store Partner Personal Data are located.</p>

<p><strong>11. Subprocessors</strong>.</p>

<p>11.1 <u>Subprocessors</u>. Google may engage Subprocessors to provide limited parts of
the Services, subject to the restrictions in these Terms.</p>
<p>11.2 <u>Subprocessing Restrictions</u>. Google will ensure that Subprocessors only access
and use Partner Data in accordance with Section 10.1 (Data Location and Transfers)
and terms of the Agreement and that they are bound by written agreements that require
them to provide at least the level of data protection required by the following, as
applicable pursuant to Section 10.2 (Transfers of Data Out of the EEA): (a) any Model
Contract Clauses entered into by Google LLC and Partner; and/or (b) any Alternative
Transfer Solution adopted by Google.</p>
<p>11.3 <u>Consent to Subprocessing</u>. Partner consents to Google subcontracting the
processing of Partner Data to Subprocessors in accordance with the Agreement. If the
Model Contract Clauses have been entered into as described above, Partner consents
to Google LLC subcontracting the processing of Partner Data in accordance with the
terms of the Model Contract Clauses.</p>
<p>11.4 <u>Additional Information</u>. Information about Third Party Subprocessors is available
at: https://cloud.google.com/terms/third-party-suppliers, as such URL may be updated
by Google from time to time. The information available at this URL is accurate as at the
time of publication. At the written request of the Partner, Google will provide additional
information regarding Subprocessors and their locations. Any such requests must be
sent to Google’s Data Privacy Office for Google Cloud Platform, the contact details of
which are set out in Section 9 (Data Privacy Office for Google Cloud Platform) above.</p>
<p>11.5 <u>Termination</u>. If the Model Contract Clauses have been entered into by the parties:
(i) Google will, at least 15 days before appointing any new Third Party Subprocessor,
inform Partner of the appointment (including the name and location of such
subprocessor and the activities it will perform) either by sending an email to Partner or
via the Admin Console; and (ii) if Partner objects to Google's use of any new Third Party
Subprocessors, Partner may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the Agreement
by giving written notice to Google within 30 days of being informed by Google of the
  appointment of such subprocessor.</p>

<p><strong>12. Liability Cap</strong>.</p>
     <p>If Google LLC and Partner enter into Model Contract Clauses as described above, then,
subject to the remaining terms of the Agreement relating to liability (including any
specific exclusions from any limitation of liability), the total combined liability of Google
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Partner and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
under or in connection with the Agreement and all those MCCs combined will be limited
       to the maximum monetary or payment-based liability amount set out in the Agreement.</p>

     <p><strong>13. Third Party Beneficiary</strong>.</p>
     <p><u>13.1 Google LLC</u> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, where
Google LLC is not a party to the Agreement, Google LLC will be a third party beneficiary
of Section 6.5 (Auditing Security Compliance), Section 11.3 (Consent to Subprocessing),
and Section 12 (Liability Cap) of these Terms.</p>
     <p><u>13.2 Other Third Parties</u>. Except as expressly provided herein and subject to Section
13.1, no one other than a party to this Agreement shall have any right to enforce any of
its terms. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes Customers, who shall not have any
right to enforce this Agreement.</p>

     <p><strong>14. Priority</strong>.</p>
     <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, to the extent of any conflict
or inconsistency between these Terms and the remaining terms of the Agreement,
       these Terms will govern.</p>

     <p><strong>Appendix 1: Categories of Personal Data and Data
Subjects</strong>.</p>
     <p>1. <u>Categories of Personal Data</u>. Data relating to individuals provided to Google via the
Services, by (or at the direction of) Partner.</p>
<p>2. <u>Data Subjects</u>. Data subjects include the individuals about whom data is provided to
Google via the Services by (or at the direction of) Partner.</p>



     <p><strong>Appendix 2: Security Measures</strong>.</p>
     <p>As of the Terms Effective Date, Google will take and implement the Security Measures
set out in this Appendix. Google may update or modify such Security Measures from
time to time provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the
degradation of the overall security of the Services.</p>
     <p><strong>1. Data Center and Network Security</strong>.</p>
     <p><u>(a) Data Centers</u>.</p>
     <p><u>Infrastructure</u>. Google maintains geographically distributed data centers. Google stores
all production data in physically secure data centers.</p>
<p><u>Redundancy</u>. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of
failure and minimize the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits,
switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The
Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and
corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities
have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and
frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer’s or internal
specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data center equipment is
scheduled through a standard change process according to documented procedures.</p>
<p><u>Power</u>. The data center electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and
maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In
most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is
provided for critical infrastructure components in the data center. Backup power is
provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)
batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts,
blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If
utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the
data center, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the diesel generator systems take
over. The diesel generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to
provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data center at full capacity
typically for a period of days.</p>
<p><u>Server Operating Systems</u>. Google servers use a Linux based implementation
customized for the application environment. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms
to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to
increase the security of the code used to provide the Services and enhance the security
products in production environments.</p>
<p><u>Businesses Continuity</u>. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect
against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and
tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.
<p><u>(b) Networks and Transmission</u>.</p>
<p><u>Data Transmission</u>. Data centers are typically connected via high-speed private links to
provide secure and fast data transfer between data centers. This is designed to prevent
data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during electronic
transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data storage media. Google transfers
data via Internet standard protocols.</p>
<p><u>External Attack Surface</u>. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and
intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential
attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external
facing systems.</p>
<p><u>Intrusion Detection</u>. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing
attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google
intrusion detection involves:</p>
<p>(i) tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through
preventative measures;</p>
<p>(ii) employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and</p>
<p>(iii) employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.</p>
<p><u>Incident Response</u>. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security
incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.</p>
<p><u>Encryption Technologies</u>. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or
TLS connection) available.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Access and Site Controls</strong></p>
     <p><u>(a) Site Controls</u>.</p>
     <p><u>On-site Data Center Security Operation</u>. Google’s data centers maintain an on-site
security operation responsible for all physical data center security functions 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operation personnel monitor closed circuit TV
(CCTV) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform
internal and external patrols of the data center regularly.</p>
     <p><u>Data Center Access Procedures</u>.Google maintains formal access procedures for
allowing physical access to the data centers. The data centers are housed in facilities
that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site
security operation. All entrants to the data center are required to identify themselves as
well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorized employees,
contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centers. Only authorized
employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these
facilities. Data center electronic card key access requests must be made through e-mail,
and requires the approval of the requestor’s manager and the data center director. All
other entrants requiring temporary data center access must: (i) obtain approval in
advance from the data center managers for the specific data center and internal areas
they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an
approved data center access record identifying the individual as approved.</p>
     <p><u>On-site Data Center Security Devices</u>. Google’s data centers employ an electronic card
key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access
control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when
they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas.
Unauthorized activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control
system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorized access throughout the business
operations and data centers is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job
responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centers are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in
operation both inside and outside the data centers. The positioning of the cameras has
been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to
the data center building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel
manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables
throughout the data centers connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on site via
digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are
retained for up to 30 days based on activity.</p>
     <p><u>(b) Access Control</u>.</p>
     <p><u>Infrastructure Security Personnel</u>. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its
personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its
personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing
monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Services, and
responding to security incidents.</p>
     <p><u>Access Control and Privilege Management</u>. Google’s internal data
access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized persons and/or
systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google
designs its systems to (i) only allow authorized persons to access data they are
authorized to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered
or removed without authorization during processing, use and after recording. The
systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralized
access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and
only provides access to a limited number of authorized personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and
a proprietary system utilizing RSA keys are designed to provide Google with secure and
flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved
access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google requires
the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully
monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The
granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job
responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; and a
need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in
accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are
managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to
systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are
employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow
at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength. For
access to extremely sensitive information (e.g. credit card data), Google uses hardware
tokens.</p>

     <p><strong>3. Data</strong></p>
     <p>(a) <u>Data Storage, Isolation and Logging</u>. Google stores data in a multi-tenant
environment on Google-owned servers. The data and file system architecture are
replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centers. Google also
logically isolates the Partner’s data. Partner will be given control over specific data
sharing policies. Those policies, in accordance with the functionality of the Services, will
enable Partner to determine the product sharing settings applicable to Partner End
Users for specific purposes. Partner may choose to make use of certain logging
capability that Google may make available via the Services.</p>
       <p>(b) <u>Decommissioned Disks and Disk Erase Policy</u>. Disks containing data may
experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be
decommissioned (“Decommissioned Disk”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a
series of data destruction processes (the “Disk Erase Policy”) before leaving Google’s
premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multistep
process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase
results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the
erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If,
due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely </p>
     <p><strong>4. Personnel Security</strong></p>
     <p>Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the
company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and
professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks
to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and
statutory regulations.</p>
     <p>Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge
receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel
are provided with security training. Personnel handling Partner Data are required to
complete additional requirements appropriate to their role (eg., certifications). Google’s
personnel will not process Partner Data without authorization.</p>
     <p><strong>5. Subprocessor Security</strong></p>
     <p>Prior to onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and
privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security
and privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are
engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the
Subprocessor, then subject to the requirements set out in Section 11.2 (Subprocessing
Restrictions) of these Terms, the Subprocessor is required to enter into appropriate
security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms.</p>

      Partner in accordance with the Terms.</p>
     <p><u>Categories of Data</u></p>
     <p>Data relating to individuals provided to Google via the Services, by (or at the direction
      of) Partner, Customers or Partner End Users.</p>
     <p><u>Data Subjects</u></p>
     <p>Data subjects include the individuals about whom data is provided to Google via the
      Services by (or at the direction of) Partner, Customers or by Partner End Users.</p>

     <p><br /><strong>Appendix 2: Security Measures</strong></p>
     <p>As from the Terms Effective Date, Google will implement and maintain the Security
      Measures set out in this Appendix 2. Google may update or modify such Security
      Measures from time to time provided that such updates and modifications do not result
      in the degradation of the overall security of the Services.</p>
     <p><strong>1. Data Center and Network Security</strong></p>
     <p><u>(a) Data Centers</u>.</p>
     <p><u>Infrastructure</u>. Google maintains geographically distributed data centers. Google stores
      all production data in physically secure data centers.</p>
     <p><u>Redundancy</u>. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of
      failure and minimize the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Dual circuits,
      switches, networks or other necessary devices help provide this redundancy. The
      Services are designed to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and
      corrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment and facilities
      have documented preventative maintenance procedures that detail the process for and
      frequency of performance in accordance with the manufacturer’s or internal
      specifications. Preventative and corrective maintenance of the data center equipment is
      scheduled through a standard change process according to documented procedures.</p>
     <p><u>Power</u>. The data center electrical power systems are designed to be redundant and
      maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In
      most cases, a primary as well as an alternate power source, each with equal capacity, is
      provided for critical infrastructure components in the data center. Backup power is
      provided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)
      batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection during utility brownouts,
      blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and out-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If
      utility power is interrupted, backup power is designed to provide transitory power to the
      data center, at full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the diesel generator systems take
      over. The diesel generators are capable of automatically starting up within seconds to
      provide enough emergency electrical power to run the data center at full capacity
      typically for a period of days.</p>
     <p><u>Server Operating Systems</u>. Google servers use a Linux based implementation
      customized for the application environment. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms
      to augment data security and redundancy. Google employs a code review process to
      increase the security of the code used to provide the Services and enhance the security
      products in production environments.</p>
     <p><u>Businesses Continuity</u>. Google replicates data over multiple systems to help to protect
      against accidental destruction or loss. Google has designed and regularly plans and
      tests its business continuity planning/disaster recovery programs.</p>
     <p><u>(b) Networks and Transmission</u>.</p>
     <p><u>Data Transmission</u>. Data centers are typically connected via high-speed private links to
      provide secure and fast data transfer between data centers. This is designed to prevent
      data from being read, copied, altered or removed without authorization during electronic
      transfer or transport or while being recorded onto data storage media. Google transfers
      data via Internet standard protocols.</p>
     <p><u>External Attack Surface</u>. Google employs multiple layers of network devices and
      intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface. Google considers potential
      attack vectors and incorporates appropriate purpose built technologies into external
      facing systems.</p>
     <p><u>Intrusion Detection</u>. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight into ongoing
      attack activities and provide adequate information to respond to incidents. Google’s
      intrusion detection involves:</p>
     <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
       <li>tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface through preventative measures;</li>
       <li>employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and</li>
       <li>employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous situations.</li>
     </ul>
     <p><u>Incident Response</u>. Google monitors a variety of communication channels for security
      incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react promptly to known incidents.</p>
     <p><u>Encryption Technologies</u>. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or
      TLS connection) available. Google servers support ephemeral elliptic curve Diffie-
      Hellman cryptographic key exchange signed with RSA and ECDSA. These perfect
      forward secrecy (PFS) methods help protect traffic and minimize the impact of a
      compromised key, or a cryptographic breakthrough.</p>
     <p><strong>2. Access and Site Controls</strong></p>
     <p><u>(a) Site Controls</u>.</p>
     <p><u>On-site Data Center Security Operation</u>. Google’s data centers maintain an on-site
      security operation responsible for all physical data center security functions 24 hours a
      day, 7 days a week. The on-site security operation personnel monitor closed circuit TV
      (CCTV) cameras and all alarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform
      internal and external patrols of the data center regularly.</p>
     <p><u>Data Center Access Procedures</u>. Google maintains formal access procedures for
      allowing physical access to the data centers. The data centers are housed in facilities
      that require electronic card key access, with alarms that are linked to the on-site
      security operation. All entrants to the data center are required to identify themselves as
      well as show proof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorized employees,
      contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data centers. Only authorized
      employees and contractors are permitted to request electronic card key access to these
      facilities. Data center electronic card key access requests must be made through e-mail,
      and require the approval of the requestor’s manager and the data center director. All
      other entrants requiring temporary data center access must: (i) obtain approval in
      advance from the data center managers for the specific data center and internal areas
      they wish to visit; (ii) sign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an
      approved data center access record identifying the individual as approved.</p>
     <p><u>On-site Data Center Security Devices</u>. Google’s data centers employ an electronic card
      key and biometric access control system that is linked to a system alarm. The access
      control system monitors and records each individual’s electronic card key and when
      they access perimeter doors, shipping and receiving, and other critical areas.
      Unauthorized activity and failed access attempts are logged by the access control
      system and investigated, as appropriate. Authorized access throughout the business
      operations and data centers is restricted based on zones and the individual’s job
      responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centers are alarmed. CCTV cameras are in
      operation both inside and outside the data centers. The positioning of the cameras has
      been designed to cover strategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to
      the data center building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security operations personnel
      manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control equipment. Secure cables
      throughout the data centers connect the CCTV equipment. Cameras record on site via
      digital video recorders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are
      retained for up to 30 days based on activity.</p>
     <p><u>(b) Access Control</u>.</p>
     <p><u>Infrastructure Security Personnel</u>. Google has, and maintains, a security policy for its
      personnel, and requires security training as part of the training package for its
      personnel. Google’s infrastructure security personnel are responsible for the ongoing
      monitoring of Google’s security infrastructure, the review of the Services, and
      responding to security incidents.</p>
     <p><u>Access Control and Privilege Management</u>. Partner’s administrators must authenticate
      themselves via a central authentication system or via a single sign on system in order to
      administer the Services.</p>
     <p><u>Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy</u>. Google’s internal data
      access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized persons and/or
      systems from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. Google
      designs its systems to (i) only allow authorized persons to access data they are
      authorized to access; and (ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered
      or removed without authorization during processing, use and after recording. The
      systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access. Google employs a centralized
      access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and
      only provides access to a limited number of authorized personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and
      a proprietary system utilizing SSH certificates are designed to provide Google with
      secure and flexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only
      approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. Google
      requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and
      carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use.
      The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s
      job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; and a
      need to know basis. The granting or modification of access rights must also be in
      accordance with Google’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are
      managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to
      systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are
      employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow
      at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength. For
      access to extremely sensitive information (e.g. credit card data), Google uses hardware
      tokens.</p>
     <p><strong>3. Data</strong></p>
     <p><u>(a) Data Storage, Isolation and Logging</u>. Google stores data in a multi-tenant
      environment on Google-owned servers. The data and file system architecture are
      replicated between multiple geographically dispersed data centers. Google also
      logically isolates the Partner’s data. Partner will be given control over specific data
      sharing policies. Those policies, in accordance with the functionality of the Services, will
      enable Partner to determine the product sharing settings applicable to Partner End
      Users for specific purposes. Partner may choose to make use of certain logging
      capability that Google may make available via the Services.</p>
     <p><u>(b) Decommissioned Disks and Disk Erase Policy</u>. Disks containing data may
      experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that lead them to be
      decommissioned (“Decommissioned Disk”). Every Decommissioned Disk is subject to a
      series of data destruction processes (the “Disk Erase Policy”) before leaving Google’s
      premises either for reuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multistep
      process and verified complete by at least two independent validators. The erase
      results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number for tracking. Finally, the
      erased Decommissioned Disk is released to inventory for reuse and redeployment. If,
      due to hardware failure, the Decommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely
      stored until it can be destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance
      with the Disk Erase Policy.</p>
     <p><strong>4. Personnel Security</strong></p>
     <p>Google personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the
      company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate usage, and
      professional standards. Google conducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks
      to the extent legally permissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and
      statutory regulations.</p>
     <p>Personnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must acknowledge
      receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality and privacy policies. Personnel
      are provided with security training. Personnel handling Partner Data are required to
      complete additional requirements appropriate to their role (eg., certifications). Google’s
      personnel will not process Partner Data without authorization.</p>
     <p><strong>5. Subprocessor Security</strong></p>
     <p>Before onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the security and privacy
      practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors provide a level of security and
      privacy appropriate to their access to data and the scope of the services they are
      engaged to provide. Once Google has assessed the risks presented by the
      Subprocessor, then subject to the requirements set out in Section 11.3 (Requirements
      for Subprocessor Engagement) of these Terms, the Subprocessor is required to enter
      into appropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms.</p>
