      <p>1.2 <u>Console</u>. Google will provide the Services to Customer. As part of receiving the Services, Customer
will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may administer the Services.</p>

      <p>1.3 <u>Facilities</u>.  All facilities used to store and process an Application and Customer Data will adhere to
reasonable security standards no less protective than the security standards at facilities where Google
processes and stores its own information of a similar type. Google has implemented at least industry
standard systems and procedures to (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of an Application and
Customer Data, (ii) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of an
Application and Customer Data, and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of an Application
and Customer Data.</p>

contingent upon Customer’s agreement to additional terms.</p>

      <p>1.6 <u>Modifications</u>.</p>

        <p>a. To the Services. Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time.
If Google makes a material change to the Services, Google will inform Customer, provided that Customer
has subscribed with Google to be informed about such change.</p>

        <p>b. To the Agreement. Google may make changes to this Agreement (and any linked documents) from
time to time. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement will become effective
30 days after they are posted, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be
effective immediately. Google will provide at least 90 days’ advance notice for materially adverse changes
to any SLAs by either: (i) sending an email to Customer’s primary point of contact; (ii) posting a notice in
the Admin Console; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to
the revised Agreement, please stop using the Services. Google will post any modification to this
Agreement to the Terms URL.</p>

        <p>c. To the Data Processing and Security Terms. Google may only change the Data Processing and
Security Terms where such change is required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, court
order, or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency, where such change is expressly
permitted by the Data Processing and Security Terms, or where such change:</p>

          <p>(i) is commercially reasonable;</p>

          <p>(ii) does not result in a degradation of the overall security of the Services;</p>

          <p>(iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Google’s processing of Customer
          Personal Data, as described in Section 5.2 (Scope of Processing) of the Data Processing and Security
            Terms; and</p>

          <p>(iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer’s rights under the Data Processing
            and Security Terms.</p>

          <p>If Google makes a material change to the Data Processing and Security Terms in accordance with this
            Section, Google will post the modification to the URL containing those terms.</p>

Department of State. Unless otherwise specified in writing by Google, Google does not intend uses of the
Services to create obligations under HIPAA, and makes no representations that the Services satisfy
HIPAA requirements. If Customer is (or becomes) a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in
HIPAA, Customer will not use the Services for any purpose or in any manner involving Protected Health
Information (as defined in HIPAA) unless Customer has received prior written consent to such use from

Services may be subject to separate license agreements. To the limited extent a third party license
expressly supersedes this Agreement, that third party license governs Customer’s use of that third party
component.</p>

      <p>2.5 <u>Documentation</u>. Google may provide Documentation for Customer’s use of the Services. The
Documentation may specify restrictions (e.g. attribution or HTML restrictions) on how the Applications
may be built or the Services may be used and Customer will comply with any such restrictions specified.</p>

      <p>2.6 <u>Copyright Policy</u>. Google provides information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual
property online, but Google cannot determine whether something is being used legally or not without their
input. Google responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates accounts of repeat
infringers according to applicable copyright laws including in particular the process set out in the U.S.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If Customer thinks somebody is violating Customer’s or Customer End
Users’ copyrights and wants to notify Google, Customer can find information about submitting notices,
and Google's policy about responding to notices at <a href="http://www.google.com/dmca.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/dmca.html</a>.</p>

violates the AUP, Customer will immediately suspend the Application or Project and/or remove the
relevant Customer Data (as applicable). If Customer fails to suspend or remove as noted in the prior
sentence, Google may specifically request that Customer do so. If Customer fails to comply with Google’s
request to do so within twenty-four hours, then Google may disable the Project or Application, and/or
disable the Account (as may be applicable) until such violation is corrected.</p>

      <p>3.2 <u>Emergency Security Issues</u>. Despite the foregoing, if there is an Emergency Security Issue, then
Google may automatically suspend the offending Application, Project, and/or Account. Suspension will be
to the minimum extent required, and of the minimum duration, to prevent or resolve the Emergency
Security Issue. If Google suspends an Application, Project, or the Account, for any reason, without prior
notice to Customer, at Customer’s request, Google will provide Customer the reason for the suspension
as soon as is reasonably possible.</p>

    <p>4. <u>Intellectual Property Rights; Use of Customer Data; Feedback</u>.</p>

announcement, unless (as Google determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):</p>

        <p>(i) required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in applicable law or
            relationship), or</p>

        <p>(ii) doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.</p>

      <p>8.2 <u>By Google</u>.

      <p>8.5 <u>Remedies.</u>.</p>

Services; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing without materially reducing their
functionality; or (c) replace the Services with a non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative.</p>

between Google Cloud India Private Limited with its registered office located at Unit No-204,
Signature Tower-II,Tower-A, 2nd Floor, Sector-15, Part II, Silokhera, Gurgaon-122001 India
(“GCI”) and the entity with a billing address in India, agreeing to these terms ("Customer").
  </p>
  <p>
    GCI is appointed by Google Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Google”), as a non-exclusive reseller of the
Services (as defined below) in India. This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks
to accept the Agreement (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you
represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement;
(ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to
this Agreement. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click to
accept. This Agreement governs Customer's access to and use of the Service. For an offline
    variant of this Agreement, you may <a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact/">contact sales</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>This Agreement sets out all terms agreed between the parties and supersedes all other
      agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter.</b>
  </p>

  <ul>
      <p>1. <u>The Services</u>.</p>
      <p>1.1 GCI sells to the Customer the Services in India. The Customer agrees that its use of the
Services is subject to Google’s Terms of Services located at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/">https://cloud.google.com/terms/</a>
(“TOS”). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning
attributed to them in the TOS.
      </p>

      <p>1.2 <u>Accounts</u>. Customer must have an Account and a Token (if applicable) to use the Services,
and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of the Token
and its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account and the Token. If Customer
becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its password, its Account or the Token, Customer
will notify GCI as promptly as possible. GCI has no obligation to provide Customer multiple
Tokens or Accounts.</p>

      <p>1.3 <u>Modifications</u>.</p>
      <p>a. <u>To the Agreement</u>. GCI may make commercially reasonable changes to this Agreement,
including pricing (and any linked documents) from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by GCI,
material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except
if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. GCI
will provide at least 90 days’ advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by
either: (i) sending an email to Customer’s primary point of contact; (ii) posting a notice in the
Admin Console; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not
agree to the revised Agreement, please stop using the Services.</p>

    <p>2 <u>Payment Terms</u>.</p>
    <p>2.1 <u>Free Quota</u>. Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee
Threshold, as applicable.</p>
    <p>2.2 <u>Online Billing</u>. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period, GCI will issue an electronic
bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on (i) Customer’s use
of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period (including, if any, the relevant Fee for
TSS set forth in the Fees definition below); (ii) any Reserved Units selected; (iii) any Committed
Purchases selected; and/or (iv) any Package Purchases selected. For use above the Fee
Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set in the Account and
will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card,
debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, GCI will charge (and Customer will pay) all
Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice
(and GCI agrees), all Fees are due as set forth in the invoice. Customer’s obligation to pay all
Fees is non-cancellable. GCI's measurement of Customer’s use of the Services is final. GCI
has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the
bank information provided by GCI.</p>
    <p>2.3 <u>Taxes</u>. (a) In consideration of services, Customer agrees to pay to GCI, the fees as
mentioned above plus applicable taxes. If GCI is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes
will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides GCI with a timely and valid tax
exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</p>
    <p>(b) If required under applicable law, Customer will provide GCI with applicable tax identification
information (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (“GSTIN”), location where the
services would be received by the customer, tax status etc.) that GCI may require to ensure its
compliance with applicable tax regulations in India. The Customer acknowledges that all the
details provided such as the GSTIN, location where the services would be received by the
customer, tax status etc. are correct. The address and GSTIN provided are of the location
where the services would be received by the Customer. Customer will be liable to pay (or
reimburse GCI for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by
the Customer.</p>
    <p>(c) If Customer is required by law to withhold any amounts for Income Tax on its payments to
GCI, Customer must provide GCI in a timely manner with a withholding tax certificate or other
appropriate documentation to support such withholding as per the applicable tax laws in India.</p>
    <p>2.4 <u>Invoice Disputes & Refunds</u>. Any invoice disputes must be submitted prior to the payment
due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to GCI, GCI
will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect
amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, GCI will apply the
credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the
resulting net balance due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer
waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not
affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of
GCI and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates
GCI to extend credit to any party.</p>
    <p>2.5 <u>Delinquent Payments; Suspension</u>. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per
month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full.
Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by
GCI in collecting such delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the Services, GCI
may suspend the Services and / or terminate the Agreement for breach pursuant to Section 9.2.</p>
    <p>2.6 <u>No Purchase Order Number Required</u>. For clarity, Customer is obligated to pay all
applicable Fees without any requirement for GCI to provide a purchase order number on GCI’s
invoice (or otherwise).</p>

    <p>3 <u>Customer Obligations</u>.</p>
    <p>3.1 <u>Compliance</u>. Customer is solely responsible for its Applications, Projects, and Customer
Data and for making sure its Applications, Projects, and Customer Data comply with the AUP.
Customer is responsible for ensuring all Customer End Users comply with Customer’s
obligations under the AUP, the Service Specific Terms, and the restrictions in Sections 3.3 and
3.5 below.</p>
    <p>3.2 <u>Privacy</u>. Customer will obtain and maintain any required consents necessary to permit the
processing of Customer Data under this Agreement.</p>
    <p>3.3 <u>Restrictions</u>. Customer will not, and will not allow third parties under its control to: (a) copy,
modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or
otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code of the Services (subject to Section 3.4
below and except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b)
use the Services for High Risk Activities; (c) sublicense, resell, or distribute any or all of the
Services separate from any integrated Application; (d) create multiple Applications, Accounts, or
Projects to simulate or act as a single Application, Account, or Project (respectively) or
otherwise access the Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees; (e) unless
otherwise set forth in the Service Specific Terms, use the Services to operate or enable any
telecommunications service or in connection with any Application that allows Customer End
Users to place calls or to receive calls from any public switched telephone network; or (f)
process or store any Customer Data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations maintained by the Department of State. Unless otherwise specified in writing by
GCI, GCI does not intend uses of the Services to create obligations under HIPAA, and makes
no representations that the Services satisfy HIPAA requirements. If Customer is (or becomes) a
Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Customer will not use the Services
for any purpose or in any manner involving Protected Health Information (as defined in HIPAA)
unless Customer has received prior written consent to such use from GCI.</p>
    <p>3.4 <u>Third Party Components</u>. Third party components (which may include open source software)
forming part of the Services may be subject to separate license agreements, which documents
GCI will provide to Customer through Google. To the limited extent a third party license
expressly supersedes this Agreement, that third party license governs Customer’s use of that
third party component.</p>
    <p>3.5 <u>Documentation</u>. GCI and/or Google may provide Documentation for Customer’s use of the
Services. The Documentation may specify restrictions (e.g. attribution or HTML restrictions) on
how the Applications may be built or the Services may be used and Customer will comply with
any such restrictions specified.</p>

    <p>4. <u>Suspension and Removals</u>.</p>
    <p>4.1 <u>Suspension/Removals</u>. If Customer becomes aware that any Application, Project, or
    Customer Data violates the AUP, Customer will immediately suspend the Application or Project
    and/or remove the relevant Customer Data (as applicable). If Customer fails to suspend or
    remove as noted in the prior sentence, GCI or Google may specifically request that Customer
    do so. If Customer fails to comply with GCI/Google’s request to do so within twenty-four hours,

    of this Section 14.4(a) prejudices the defense of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding, the
    indemnifying party’s obligations under Section 14.1 or 14.2 (as applicable) will be reduced in
    proportion to the prejudice.</p>
    <p>b. The indemnified party tenders sole control of the indemnified portion of the Third-Party Legal
