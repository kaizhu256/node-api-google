Committed Unit purchases may be made for a Committed Unit Term.</p>
      <p>b. <u>Renewal</u>. Unless otherwise set forth in the Admin Console or other documentation, after each Committed Unit Term (if any) ends that Committed Unit selection will automatically renew for the same Committed Unit Term at the same quantity throughout the Term until Customer selects in the Admin Console to stop renewing or cancel the renewal (if applicable) or either party notifies the other party to cancel the renewal. A renewal cancellation will take effect after the then current Committed Unit Term ends.</p>
      <p>c. <u>Cancellation and Expiration</u>. Unless Google agrees otherwise, Committed Unit purchases may not be cancelled or refunded after they are placed but if Google (other than for Customer’s material breach) terminates the Agreement or discontinues providing the Services applicable to the Committed Units, Google will refund Customer any unused prepaid Fees following that termination applicable to those previously purchased Committed Units. If Google allows Customer to cancel a Committed Unit purchase, Google may require Customer to pay a cancellation Fee (in an amount set forth at the URL designating the Fees for the applicable SKU). Any use of the Services after cancellation or expiration of the Committed Units will be billed at standard Fee rates.</p>
      <p>d. <u>No Resell or Transfer</u>. Unless Google agrees otherwise, Customer may not resell or transfer Committed Units.</p>
