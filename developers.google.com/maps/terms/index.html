      Thank you for your interest in the Google Maps APIs.
      The Google Maps APIs are a collection of services

      content from Google in your web pages or applications.
    </p>

    <p>Last Updated: February 7, 2018</p>

      If you have questions about these terms, please consult the FAQ’s
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#tos">Terms of Service section</a>. These terms
      do not apply if you have entered into a separate written agreement
      with Google (such as a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan or

        Your use of any of the Google Maps APIs (referred to in this document as
        the "<strong>Maps API(s)</strong>" or the "<strong>Service</strong>") is subject to the
        terms of a legal agreement between you and Google (the "<strong>Terms</strong>").
        "<strong>Google</strong>" means either (a) Google Ireland Limited, with offices at
        Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, if your billing address is in any country
        within Europe, the Middle East, or Africa ("<strong>EMEA</strong>"); (b) Google Asia Pacific

              without an Ads Notice, Google will not include advertising
              in that API’s maps images unless Google provides you with

              (the "Ads Notice Period").

              If your Maps API Implementation incorporated a major
              version of a Maps API before April 8, 2011, you have a
              limited right to opt out of advertising in the maps images
              provided through that major version of that Maps API by
              providing written notice to Google during the Ads Notice
              Period; your notice must state that you refuse to accept
              advertising in the maps images and must be provided to

              (as specified in Google's Ads Notice).
