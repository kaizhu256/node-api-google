    <h2 id="general-legal-terms" style="display: none">25. General Legal Terms</h2>
    <p><b>General Legal Terms.</b></p>
 
    <p>25.1 <b>Entire Agreement.</b> The Agreement controls the relationship between you and YouTube and constitutes the entire agreement between such parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>

    <p>25.2 <b>Third-Party Beneficiary.</b> Each Affiliate of YouTube is a third-party beneficiary under the Agreement and is entitled to directly rely on and enforce any right or benefit provided to it under the Agreement. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement.</p>

    <p>25.3 <b>No Waiver.</b> YouTube will not be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under the Agreement. A waiver will be effective only if YouTube expressly states in writing signed by an authorized representative that YouTube is waiving a specified term of the Agreement.</p>

    <p>25.4 <b>Severability.</b> If it turns out that a particular provision of the Agreement is found to be not enforceable, that provision will be modified by the court of competent jurisdiction to the extent necessary to create an enforceable provision that reflects the parties' intention as closely as possible. If that is not possible, it will be deemed deleted and the rest of the Agreement will continue in force unaffected.</p>

    <p>25.5 <b>Requesting Agreement Modifications.</b> You may grant approvals, permissions and consents to YouTube by email, but any modifications requested by you to the Agreement must be made in writing (not including email) and signed by both YouTube and your authorized representative who has the authority to bind you (and only if YouTube agrees to such modification).</p>

    <p>25.6 <b>Notices.</b> All notices to YouTube must be in the English language, in writing, and sent to our corporate headquarters address listed on our website via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt.</p>

    <p>25.7 <b>Assignment of the Agreement.</b> YouTube may transfer or assign the Agreement, including any rights and licenses granted under it, to a third party, but you may not.</p>

    <p>25.8 <b>Relationship of the Parties.</b> You are not YouTube’s legal partner or agent; the parties are independent contractors.</p>

    <p>25.9 <b>Change of Control.</b> If you or any party operating your API Client(s) on your behalf experience a change of control (for example, through a stock purchase or sale, merger or other form of corporate transaction), you will provide to YouTube a written notice detailing the change of control within 15 calendar days after the change of control via <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/ytapiuserchangeofcontrol/">this form</a>. YouTube will review the completed form and if it is not approved within 45 calendar days after the change of control, your project ID will automatically terminate.</p>

    <p>25.10 <b>YouTube Approvals.</b> YouTube may deny or grant any consents, approvals, or permissions that are expressly contemplated under the Agreement or otherwise requested by you at our discretion.</p>

    <p>25.11 <b>Governing Law and Venue.</b> The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services. Subject to Section 22 (Injunctive Relief), all claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., and you and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

    <p>25.12 <b>Limitation on Actions.</b> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE YOUTUBE API SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

    <p>25.13 <b>Translations.</b> Any local language translation (where applicable) exists for reference purposes only, and only the English version will be legally binding. If there is any inconsistency between the two versions, the English version shall control.</p>
